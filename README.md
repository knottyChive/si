# Si News App
This is a personal project that displays the news from the NewsAPI. The project was coded using a NodeJS, ExpressJS, EJS, and deployed with Heroku. 

## Focus 
The focus on this project was mainly functionality rather than design and improving my server-side MVC rendering using EJS. 

## Site Structure
    Index --> Main Display
    Sources --> Displays all News Sources provided by API
    News by Source --> Routing to display custom news based on the source
    _Future Update_ --> Instead of linking to original post elsewhere, I want to set up a GET route to pull all the data into a template for view on this app.
